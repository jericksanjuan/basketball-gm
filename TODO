  balance
  minutes directly, not by +/-

  free agents and trades matters....
  bump up penalties for unbalanced teams
    the tricky part is that finding a factor and using it to create variance leads to variance on the CPU-generated teams
    could play with turnover probability too
    rewrite gamesim, fixing all these problems? also, coaching less agressively when game is blowout, playing stars more in important games, ...
    tricky: good teams have high skill players, who are going to do really well in any synergy metric. so it's hard to punish unbalanced teams through synergy without decreasing parity by a lot
      hacky approach: stay with something similar to current system, but with an extra penalty for very unbalanced teams (could be sigmoidal so it only affects really poorly balanced teams)
    probably will need to increase synergyFactor
    might need to tweak some probabilities if this changes stats too much
    redo ovr formula

Make AI smarter when constructing teams. Then, if that works, make synergy more impactful

  add subtype or something to feats

store some data in memory
  goals
    playerStats first
    then non-retired players
    then teams
  method
    generic layer over IDB?
    wrapper function specific to how data is actually queried?
    need to flush to db some time?
    will inherently be more risky than using a "real" transaction, shit could get out of sync
  transaction management
    should be fine if the cache is synchronous
  multi-window
    service worker or shared worker
      but how do they use transactions?

in-memory cache
  when starting to play games (>1 day), "get" and "getAll" add object stores to cache (if they aren't already there) and "put" updates cached values and set marker saying they were updated
  When games are over, write to database any cached values that were updated
  what about other types of operations?
    iterate: maybe cache query and check for duplicate query? not sure. this is tricky
    others: maybe not needed for this application
  NEW PLAN - apply only to players
    writes to db (add, put, cursor.update) also write to cache (do clone before write)
    ObjectStore.get - read from cache first, only hit db if cache miss
    ObjectStore.getAll - read from db
    ObjectStore.openCursor - read from db
    Index.get - read from db
    Index.getAll - read from db (maybe special case for getting all based on single tid)
    Index.openCursor - read from db
  then teams cache - similar
  really, 2 paths forward:
    1. generic caching layer on top of IndexedDB (or my promises-based library) - maybe using fakeIndexedDB
    2. write more specific dao (like sdw) and write caching (or other) layer specific to that

multi team UI - click from league to main dashboard and switch teams menu persists

screenshot
  what do i link to? Imgur landing page? or include social links directly?
    include social links directly. actually that should be the first-level UI - you don't click "Screenshot" you click "Share to X" where X is Twitter, FB, Reddit, etc
      probably still save to imgur first
      autocomplete wording: "Draft players, manage teams, go for the championship. How good a Basketball GM are you? Find out at http://basketball-gm.com"
      also autocomplete hashtag
  add prompts to take screenshots at various points
  things can get cut off right, like wide tables in player pages

event tracking
  in addition to GA, have my own system that is more in depth
    tricky part: users who aren't logged in
  what else to track?

BBGM Gold?
  add achievement
  account page UI
    if user's account exists but has not been paid, should show warning and link to card update rather than stripe button
      if not cancelled but timestamp too low
  change basketball to gold coin
  http vs https URLs plan
    http version
      DONE New League button goes always to https
      DONE button linking to https after New League
      DONE account links always go to new version (make sure login persists, it seems to)
      DONE auto redirect to https if no leagues
      http version gets no more updates? would require splitting to another site on webfaction
      eventually could delete old version (would need GA-based evidence it's not used)
        could delete old upgrade code, 12 and older
    https version
      DONE button linking to http after New League
    redirect domain http to https: http://docs.webfaction.com/software/static.html#static-redirecting-from-http-to-https
      DONE for root
      remaining: beta, play, and account

Contract negotiation revamp
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2rb4pz/apologies_for_any_bugs_i_just_introduced/cnewnr7?context=3
  Perhaps replace it with a simple drop-down menu where you can select the amount of years and the salary. So, say, a certain player has the following options, of which you can select one and sign him without negotiating:
    5 years - 13M/y
    4 years - 15M/y
    3 years - 20M/y
    2 years - Refuses
    1 year - Refuses

THE FLATTENING
--------------

clean up
  replace getObjectStore with tx_
  throw error in inappropriate/unknown input param (like "pid")
  throw error if tx passed to dao.tx is something besides transaction/null/undefined
  dao.players.getAll -> player.getAllWithStats
    the stats stuff could be put in some other function to be called after getAll
      this would allow the elimination of the "filter" option, which now is applied between getAll and adding stats
  hide g.dbl and g.dbm inside dao so i can't stupidly use them by mistake
  what about creating, migrating, and deleting databases? and objectStoreNames?
  don't use "ot" anywhere - it's all transactions so call it tx
  don't start transaction from nothing in utility function, and don't use oncomplete. always specify transaction if atomicity is needed. use this to put phase changes all in one transaction
  extract it as a library named "baseline"
  improve API
    instead of dao.os.whatever({ot: aaa}) why not do tx.os.whatever()?
      see promises_super_tx branch
      or could be dao.tx().then(function (tx) {}) and resolve that promise oncomplete? but how to pass value to then?
  IDBCursor used in helpers.js

API design
  player.filter and team.filter should be renamed, otherwise it's confusing
    player.fitler -> player.process
    team.filter -> team.getAndProcess

rewrite old upgrading code? eventually, leave it there for now

after fully abstracting IndexedDB, could i improve performance by running it locally in node and using another database?
  same with mobile on phonegap
  same with web - "turbo mode" where only one window (db connection) is allowed and caching is heavy

PERFORMANCE CRAP
----------------

is iOS detector working? getting weird errors in logs

test!
  write unit tests for dao.players.getAll
    if you request a stats season that doesn't exist, does the callback still get executed?
    if no players are returned by query, does the callback still get executed?
    if filter removes all players, does the callback still get executed?

show "loading" indicator when uploading large file, otherwise seems to hang and not allow you to click
  should be some generic one, thin bar at top like youtube

deleteOldData
  is playerStats still most important? benchmark
  break up deletion of old ratings and stats?

player.updateValues.getStats doesn't really make sense. Should get all from past 2 seasons, sort by PSID, and take stats up to 2000 minutes

more normalization? team stats, team seasons, player ratings

PHASE TWO: store retired players in a different object store

PHASE THREE: store non-retired players and playerStats in memory
  PROBLEM: to do anything fancy with this, like avoiding writing to DB, it'd make multi-window play impossible
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lovefield-users/Xs97HL4tDfk
  on page load, read all into g.playersCache and g.playerStatsCache
  dao.players.getAll can check the index and key properties to see if players are in memory. if so, skip IDB
  is it possible to abstract all IDB updating functions to copy to memory too? would just need wrappers around put (already have it) and cursor.update.
  g.playerStatsCache can be used to get stats to compute player.value, replacing current method

PLAYER DEVELOPMENT REVAMP
-------------------------

shouldn't have literally every aging player turn into a great shooter

old players are currently undervalued

player development revamp http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2cz7r6/player_development_code_has_kinda_ridiculous/
  too random, like players with pot=ovr are too likely to improve, makes low ovr high pot players less appealing http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/36402p/how_does_potential_for_players_work_in_basketball/cravpqu?context=3
  something needs to be done. still too many 3 point shooting centers
  are ovr/pot combos reasonable, since ovr is weighted now?
  old stars should exist
  reports that there are too many PGs with high pot - probably because they can't improve hgt, and hgt is highly weighted in ovr
  too many rookies come in as instant stars. should be more gradual.
  career arcs for ratings - like low endurance/athleticism for old players, but skills remain
  smaller improvement per year, but more consistent
  if ovr==pot for young player, debug.averageCareerArc(50, 50) should be flat but it's a bit bumpy
options:
  compute "pot" for each rating, use that to generate displayed pot
  somehow do it organically, with different rates of growth in different categories
current beta issues:
  different types of players should develop differently
    maybe make it multiplicative? should be much more likely to go from 50-100 than 0-100
    or cutoff-based, like if you're below 20 you're never going to improve there?
    or position-based? height-based?
    ideal: skill-based, train them as a real coach would
  newly-generated players don't have right skill labels
  tune with debug.averageCareerArc(30, 80)

Too many good free agents available at the minimum: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2sxs4l/love_the_game_suggestion_for_free_agency/

TEAM.VALUECHANGE REVAMP

http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/255sta/i_think_we_need_longer_dynasty_achievements/che050a?context=3
IMPORTANT http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20i6v3/still_too_easy_to_trade_for_drafted_players/
  just drafted players are undervalued, possibly related to the following issue
PER scaling in player.value is wrong http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1y2lci/some_thoughts/cfgz8yk
  change scaling in ovr formula? too confusing?
  this impacts rookie values, leating to an EXPLOIT: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1y2lci/some_thoughts/cfhkvnv
ovr changes should impact player.value, somehow
  probably by scaling PER from the previous season
    but what about old players? is this already factored in to the age decline in player.value?
    but are past years ratings always available from player.value? or is it sometimes done with fake player objects? need to check
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1ydtpd/seems_much_more_random_now/cfjxhj6
    teams do overvalue their own players in trades, generally
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2iuc4l/kind_of_a_glitch_that_i_noticed_during_my_last/
second round draft picks are undervalued. also, giving away a pick should never make a trade worse, but sometimes it does now. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bg3zx/simple_feature_mark_players_as_offlimits_when_we/cj5ap89
trade for tons of cheap second round picks, then use that to trade for good asset: www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/27wjnp/33_pennies_for_a_dollar/
release and resign pick exploit http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zn61h/finances/cfvzr35\
some limit on trades so people can't make 1000 slightly beneficial trades: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zzwbs/suggestions_on_trades/cg0e0dg
  probably make opposing owners less likely to trade as the number of proposed trades increases in a season
Eventually:
  "What would make this work?" functions should know about contending/rebuilding. Contending teams should be more eager to offer up young/cheap players, rebuilding teams should be more eager to offer up old/expensive players
    basically, they should view the trade from the other team's perspective, not just their own
  Can I provide better feedback about trade? Like if it's close or not? Or if it's rejected because of cap space issues?
  Set params with optimization algorithm
  Fix needToDrop stuff
    Problem now is, contract gets pushed into someone on the roster and it's lost. This is especially obvious if there is only one player in add and his contract is pushed to roster, then the trade is nothing.
    Probably not that important, since teams almost always have shitty players at the end of their rosters
  EXPLOIT that might be tricky to solve: in the "resigning players" phase, your free agents should still count towards your cap. Otherwise, you can trade to take on salary and then sign your players over the cap
  Should draft pick contract "worth" be determined better somehow, like it is for normal contracts? probably yes
    does this allow removal of fudge factor?
  population (i.e. richness) should influence opinion of contracts

PERFORMANCE CRAP
----------------

separate active and retired players into separate object stores

-------

percentages for FG, FT, 3pt below box score like Yahoo
game log for individual player
  in each box score, include an array of players in the game. index on that.

  draftexpress? emailed them, if no reply, maybe scrape
great ideas: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2q9yn8/ideas_questions_and_feedback_feel_free_to_add/
create a player during the playoffs and his stats row won't show up until the next season. basic problem seems to be that no playoff stats are returned if htere are no regular season stats
a 0 day injury doesn't show up in box score, so it looks like player was just benched http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/2pfuyr
career ending "injuries" http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2oo32x/are_there_career_ending_injuries/
if playoffSeries already exists, don't try to create again http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2on0ij/a_bug_will_not_advance_to_playoffs_errors_in_log/
  use put, not add
when uploading league file, no need to read whole thing in just to show teams menu. only need to read up to teams. but how?
simulate in multiple tabs -> NaN
should be impossible to have a player average 0 assists in big minutes

      if prospect, add "draft" button?
      if so, factor out from draft page and add on player page
    ADD TO PLAYER PAGE, elsewhere?
show prospects before draft

    ratings should really update annually, just like in normal years
      fuzz changing for prospects should factor in changes in scouting budget
    movement between draft classes
      allow promising to draft a player at certain position to influence decision
career stats
  "All Seasons" option - add each unique player/season combo as a row, include column for year
  column/table widths?
  EWA in averages should be average
    if i change how it comes from player.filter, make sure it doesn't fuck up HoF
    same with per36
per36, totals, playoffs options elsewhere
  currently in playerStats and watchList, but too much copy/paste. refactor before expanding
  team history
  roster
per 36 stats in player pages http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1ofz6s/per36_stats/
  already implemented for stats page, but should it be a separate entry from player.filter like playoffs? totals isn't. maybe should just be a dropdown to change this all on the player page?
when left menu is shown (lg), don't show the same top menus (only tools and help). but adding hidden-lg to top menu items makes them persist when going from league to non-league dashboard

      contract negotiation - show warning if the exception will be used
      resigning players page
      update manual
    implementation
      flag in root of team object - exception available, exception used, exception not granted this season
  add some fucking market shit. calculate the salary demanded by free agents vs cap space available, then adjust free agent demands somehow
    this should be part of the daily updating. if everyone is capped out, drop all salaries to minimum.
notification system
  customize: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1re3ea/new_feature_notification_bubbles/cdmjdyn
  "healed" should show after game, not before
  when fading out, hover should stop animation, remove notification-delete, reset timer to 1s (or something)
    hover on fading in should also stop animation so there is no stutter
  what about for small screens? maybe just show one at a time. is this actually a problem?
  also log these events:
    fired - log, but don't show
    new team
  notify
    when something happens to a player on the watch list
    big AI moves - trades, free agent signings
  merge "retired" and "HOF" notifications for a player on the user's team
  important notifications should be a different color, maybe require acknowledgement before closing
    errors

  slower picks http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r70dv/trade_picks_during_draft
  sort by generic value (current) or team-specific value
  trade picks - note that the code in teamValue will need to be modified to account for the lottery and available players in the draft class
power rankings
  preseason too
  awards watch

fix contracts, signing
  goal: reasonable total payrolls, no good free agents left every season
  if WS distribution matches NBA, then look at $ vs WS. even better, build a multivariate model with age

    too easy to get high percentage inside looks even with a team of all bigs?
    or should some of the "bigs" really be smalls, just mislabeled as PFs?
  make it less easy to get high percentage shots if there is no ball handling
    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  situational awareness http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1yg6wi/end_of_game_simulation/
  mediocre players on bad teams should be less efficient (shouldn't put up such a high PER, which falls if they join a good team)

MINOR FIXES
-----------

komapping things should use update as well as create!
  get rid of mapping where possible
  related to roster bug?
show team records in box score http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2dkpzw/request_team_record_in_box_scores/
retired players should be eligible for season awards
TS%

  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2agxoe/questions_and_suggestions_from_a_new_player/
smoother multi-window updates
  instead of dbChange, cache previous updateEvents and pass them
    cache expiration?
most improved player
assist leaders too low
Number of years in college should depend on talent level
DataTables - fix default sort order on column click
  text should be asc, numeric should be desc (except draft picks)
  http://datatables.net/ref#asSorting will work. maybe pass it as an option to bbgm_datatable
  but can it be set globally, based on column type? can have ui.datatable automatically read columns and figure it out?
Add MVP and Titles columns to HoF table
Make good young players much less likely to become FAs
Make rookie contracts 1 year longer
top menu tooltips for md
show team records in playoffs, conference standings
don't need to store abbrev with awards, just tids
  fix display in season summary (correct in historyAll)
show team records in playoffs page
on team history, show counts of conf/league championships, hall of fame players, etc
if a player refuses to resign, that decision should also be reflected in free agency (don't recalculate mood)
add "drb" to usage so that good ball handlers shoot more (favor guards over bigs more)
in player page, show red/green for ratings changes from the previous year, maybe as heatmap
in ratings tables, show dpot and dovr columns? maybe?
more owner messages - crowdsource? especially intro
Add markers for clinching playoffs / 1st seed in league standings
trading block crashing bug
  happens in chrome in old leagues, apparently. running out of memory somehow?
expand play menu so it can be used with one click http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1ry65b/best_method_of_giving_feedback_and_requesting_new/cds6hph
first errorNotify in contractNegotiation.js really should be inline within that page
league leaders glitch http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r20x5/league_leaders_bug/

make sure the changes alert and the "refuses to negotiate" alert both look good
  link to player in "refuses to negotiate" alert
replace random.gauss with random.realGauss
current season shouldn't show in league history page dropdown
make trade counter-offer faster by checking if no trade is possible first http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jumc9/is_it_just_me_or_does_it_take_wayyyy_too_long_for/
document things that affect player mood
security
  validate any user-added content, like custom team names (both in file and through form), custom players, and league names
in playoffs, replace "play week" with "play until end of round"
don't need to check every team's roster limits every time games are played - could auto keep AI teams in line after any trade (with user or between AI teams), and then only the user's team needs to be checked
reorganize top menu
http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/ or something similar
in playoffs, replace Week/Month in Play menu with Round http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1w55sb/suggestionplayoffs_simulate_by_round_instead_of/
gamesim shot distribution - less people shooting 3s really poorly, especially tall players
UI to easily switch between conference and division standings on small screens and dashboard http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2d4o9r/feature_requests_of_the_week_august_10_2014/cjqrwtf?context=3
schedule page (and dashboard and maybe gamelog) should show opponent records
add "play until end of quarter" in live gamesim

tanking is too easy http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20038f/too_easy_to_tank/
contractNegotiation
  young players should only want short deals if they have really high pot-ovr
box plots / distributions
  "it'd be great to overlay your roster to see where you stand. Maybe click on a name in a list to add or remove it from the display. Do I have a fast team? Do I have a three point shooting team? Are we big and bruising and slow?"

        make sure to use on player page too.. can i use helpers.playerName.. there too?
    table headers
    others?
  any columns: *em css - can't i make columns use bootstrap?
some kind of playoff series overview page, including box scores for easy access
luxury tax money should be redistributed to non-taxpaying teams (or teams under the cap?)
A year-to-date comparison of team finances with the previous year.
better core.player.ovr formula
  regression: player = require('core/player'); player.regressRatingsPer();
    weight by minutes played
  THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WHEN PLAYER GENERATION/DEVELOPMENT OR GAMESIM CHANGES!
different owner personalities, with different priorities
trades
  "undo" button for accidental trades
    transaction log first. put "Undo" button after message from other GM only right after a trade finishes. make sure it doesn't show up at other time
      only allow undo if dbChange hasn't changed since the transaction was logged
  "When signing free agents, if you offer then a contract 2 years longer/shorter than the one they want, they'll counter offer one with 1 more/less year. If you offer the same amount of money you previously offered, and change the year to what they want, they'll automatically offer the lowest $ for that amount of years."

dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
some UI indicating how players developed over the offseason
  integrated into roster, or separate page?
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
  search by stats, ratings, or attributes
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent, or draft button if draft prospect
    same contextual buttons for watch list
    can this become main UI for drafting (at least fantasy draft)
finances
  too easy to make big $$$
    owner should take profits each year
  AI teams should adjust spending
player morale - punishment for tanking
team colors, and uniforms in player icons
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
playerNameLabels should also put a little hover box over the player link with key stats/ratings
more refined control of playing time

  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qaml8/playing_time_explain_to_me_like_im_8/
  just set minutes directly? any minutes not included, leave up to coach's discretion
draft
  randomness in picks should factor in relative ratings http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l1713/the_draft_still_needs_some_work_it_seems_my/cbutw7v?context=1
  somehow allow uploading of custom draft classes
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
    generalize core.trade.makeItWork and other parts of core.trade
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
  also propose trades to the user, somehow
IE support
  dropdowns disappear on refresh?
    unit tests fail too, seemingly for the same reason
  text in dashboard is messed up
  compound indexes
core.team.valueChange should be used to pick which free agents to sign in core.freeAgents.autoSign, but that would be a bitch beacuse of how transactions are set up
  also for resigning players in core.season
trades
  cash
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
profits too large, too easy
  add corporate tax?
  luxury tax increases for repeat offenders?
only show retired players in season summary if they actually played some
components.dropdown tests are very slow in chrome
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  download link performance
    http://mjtemplate.org/examples/rison.html
    something besides a data URI?
    no base64? Firefox can't handle #
  error handling if blank or invalid file is supplied
  easily edit in excel?
move most db functions into core.whatever. db should just be about initializing/upgrading
  get rid of "db" module dependence
core.freeAgents should be core.freeAgent or core.freeAgency?
after last resigning negotiation, switch to next phase?
draft lottery
  do a dramatic presentation?
  increase hype for teams that exceed expectations
  tied records?
  should happen in "before draft" phase to allow trading early
increase hype for big free agent signings
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
contracts
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
luxury tax should be disbursed amongst non-taxpaying teams
team.rosterAutoSort should automatically set dbChanged, and have an option to not if that's important
test trades more
  multi-player valuation
    rank players by value. each additional value gets some multiplier to diminish its influence. this prevents adding a player to a trade from decreasing its value
    but this should have something to do with the difference between numbers of players on each side?
if fouling out drops team below 5 active players, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
show old contracts on old roster view
reassess ui module. delete stuff like ui.dropdown. move other functions elsewhere?
  what is the difference between util.viewHelpers, views.components, and ui?
can i get rid of js/api.js?
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, with message like in team finances
too easy to do the "be bad, get draft picks, keep payroll low, sign free agents, be good" pattern
  free agents are even less willing to sign with the user, even if it's a good team
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
database changes
  add activeYears multientry like statsTids use for:
    league leaders
    stats
    ratings
gameSim
  use real clock (this.t) rather than number of possessions
  teams should play quicker as the clock runs out
    more generally, teams should have situational awareness
  more penalty for really unbalanced rosters: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cba743c?context=3
  rename compositeRating to compositeRatings (or something better)
    other plural issues in gameSim
  playing time not adding up to 240?
  do some kind of profiling, see if i can speed it up
    any way to speed up PER? maybe break it up into smaller functions so they can be profiled
    do i need all the player composite ratings?
    do i need all the team composite ratings?
    how does performance change/degrade as the years go on?
  bench players should get minutes in blowouts
in lock functions, update g from database before using any potentially sensitive values
  or should these g.whatever variables be set at all if they're sensitive? lid doesn't change obviously, but the others?
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
customize which columns are shown in roster view (and possibly other summary views like trade, free agent, etc)
  http://datatables.net/extras/colvis/
  would it be better just to toggle displays? http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1ygzlt/idea_watch_list_toggle_between_stats_and/
    could be different levels of detail (all stats, some stats, min stats) and have these preprogrammed in somehow for toggling to the same number of ratings
AI teams should periodically reorder rosters throughout the season
PER
  slow, particularly after multiple seasons?
    can i have it share a transaction with writing stats in core.game?
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
  more general: have "media" reporting things like 10 worst contracts, etc
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract

FUTURE
------

event log UI
  allow filtering type with checkboxes
  what about events with no tid? they are currently not viewable
draftOrder should just be in globals, not a real table
shot charts showing hot spots (red/yellow/green) based on shot location data
most improved player

      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
stat views
  playoff/regular season toggle in team/player stats, league leaders
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
"dbChanged" updateEvent - more correct way
  store a list of times and "update events". compare last updated time against that list, and then see the update events. pass as list in "update event" to realtime update
  check everywhere dbChange or lastDbChange is set and see if it should be more refined
    add playerMovement updateEvent, for when a player signs a contract, becomes a free agent, or is traded
  or use something like broadcastchannel https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/trainspotting-firefox-38/
bbgmView
  can i do some check to abandon display if idLoading is mismatched with reality? like for clicking a slow link followed by a fast link, in rapid succession, the fast output should show and the slow should be short circuited.
    in practice, this doesn't seem to matter much
  shouldn't have newPhase updateEvent doing much. instead, have an array of what changed in that phase
    (updateEvents.indexOf("newPhase") >= 0 && g.phase === g.PHASE.PRESEASON) should be newSeason
  use req.redirect from POST to manage history optimally
  make it less tied to BBGM specifically. shouldn't depend on BBGM-specific modules like g, ui, and util/viewHelpers
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.

    game clock using min - more accurate, but more complicated - does this even work?
  could fake where the shots are to display graphically
  when someone wins the title, you can see the phase change at the top even while watching the live play-by-play of the last game. this leaks info about who won
  allow the user to make substitutions in realtime
when i have more money, get logos and colors for default teams - maybe by /u/mbingcrosby or /u/R_E_D_D_l_T
multi team trades

Template Stuff
--------------

Below are relatively boring/minor improvements that would make the templating slightly better/faster/clearer/whatever.

gameLog
  boxScore should be observable, but nothing inside should be except gid
dashboard
  observables set right by mapping
    historical things (old scores, old records) don't need to be observable?
    arrays need correct keys
team finances
  smarter updating of player salaries table: contracts should only update on playerMovement
feasible to use knockout for updating datatable? or kogrid?
trade - not fully knockoutifieid
  mapping to update summary.teams.trade, userRoster, otherRoster
  can i do a redirect from post without refreshing everything?
    just call ui.realtimeUpdate which should allow for smart handling
      if trade is accepted/cleared, playerMovement will instigate a refresh of rosters
      if trade is proposed, message will somehow explicity be sent (set in VM? but what if VM not initialized?)
  when to delete stored message?
    at beginning of new propose
    on clear
    when team changes
  changing the trading partner shouldn't refresh the user's team
negotiation
  some things can probably be non-observable
draftSummary
  don't show this season as option if before draft - have an option in components.dropdown
playerNameLabels always updates even if none of the inputs did - why
  if ratings.skills is generated by the mapping plugin, it's an observable array and this fucks things up. it would be a bitch to fix, though.
    quick fix - return a string for templates rather than array.
leaders
  flatten a bit
roster
  check release, buy out, trade for
  flatten a bit
  vars.ptModifiers does not need to be observable
  for some reason, vars.players.injury stuff isnt' observable so days remaining injured doesn't update in a timely manner. very bizarre
dataTables/grid knockout
  examples
    https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions
      https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions/issues/9
    https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/KoGrid
    http://chadmullins.com/javascript/knockout-js-series-part-2-binding-knockout-js-to-a-datatables-grid/
inbox
  on new message (can be a newMessage update event), just add to messages list rather than always refreshing
player_
  face display with forward/back button?
    some things become observables - why???
    mapping function not run right the second time - try to create jsfiddle
      arrays are becoming observableArrays
schedule, teamHistory
  partial load of list for updates, like in gameLog list
freeagents
  optimize refreshes
dist
  allow updating box plots without refresh
gameLog
  set more stuff through mapping
reassess dropdown - should it really be called like it is in uiEvery? can i use a computed? problem is, some things need to listen to updateEvents too, not just observables
eventLog
  don't need things inside events observableArray to be observable
