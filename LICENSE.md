**BASKETBALL GM IS NOT OPEN SOURCE!** But it's not completely closed either.
It's somewhere in between. My goal is to allow others to see and contribute to
Basketball GM without being able to set up competing versions of the game.

# Things you are allowed to do with the source code

(This is an exhaustive list! These 4 things are literally all you are allowed to
do with the code. Nothing else is allowed.)

- **View it.** No restrictions.

- **Edit it.** No restrictions if it's private; if you want to share it, see
  below.

- **Run it locally.** NOBODY BUT YOU CAN ACCESS IT! YOU CANNOT MAKE IT AVAILABLE
  TO USE ONLINE!

- **Share it, including changes.** YOU CAN SHARE THE CODE, NOT A PLAYABLE GAME!
  Your changes must be made under this license and you must assign copyright to
  me, Jeremy Scheff.

# Things you are not allowed to do

(This is *not* an exhaustive list! These 4 things are *not* the only things you
are not allowed to do with the code. You are only allowed to do the 4 things
from the first section.)

- **Host a version of the software that others can access.**
  <http://basketball-gm.com/> is the only publicly available version of the
  software that can be easily used. If you want to make changes to the software
  that other people can use, contribute them back to the project so they can go
  live on <http://basketball-gm.com/>.

- **Make any kind of redistributable installer.** For example, you can't wrap a
  version of the software in something like Phonegap to let people easily
  install it on their mobile devices. You can't put it in some downloadable
  Windows installer. You can't do anything to distribute the software to end
  users. Only I can do that stuff. You can only share the source code and the
  instructions in README.md for running it.

- **Do some trivial bullshit to get around the previous restrictions.** I'm not
  a lawyer so maybe there is some loophole. Don't use it. My goal here is to
  allow my code to be as publicly available as possible without cannibalizing
  traffic from http://basketball-gm.com/. Please don't make me regret this
  decision.

- Let me reiterate one more time: **you can't in any way deploy the software for
  public use or compete with http://basketball-gm.com/**.
