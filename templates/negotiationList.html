<p>You are allowed to go over the salary cap to re-sign your players before they become free agents. If you do not re-sign them before free agency begins, they will be free to sign with any team, and you won't be able to go over the salary cap to sign them.
</p>
<p>
Your players will decide before the start of free agency. The mood meter will indicate the likeliness of them resigning with you. Aim for a green mood meter.
